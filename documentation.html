  <header>What exactly are auras?</header>
  <p><code><i>“As human beings, we radiate a very low level of electricity that’s otherwise known as an electromagnetic field”</i>, says Christina Lonsdale, a Portland-based artist behind a popular aura photography practice called Radiant Human.</p>
<p>Ancient systems of medicine, such as Hindu scriptures like the Vedas, believe that this energy is expressed in seven layers. Each layer is said to correlate to a different element of your physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional health.
It’s thought that these layers can interact with one another to influence your overall health.</p>
<p>Your aura is thought to be a luminous body that surrounds your physical one. Each layer — and any problems in them — surrounds your body in a net of energy.

  <header>Are auras real?</header>
  <p><code>Though no scientific studies exist to prove the existence of auras, many practices and philosophies do believe that they are real. However, the interpretation of what an aura actually is may vary among practices and philosophies.</p>
<p>All things have energy. It’s the way you send out vibes or awareness. But it’s unclear whether that energy can truly be thought of as a manifestation of the spiritual and physical body.</p>
<p>In other words, not everyone believes that auras are a reflection of your state of being.
One way to think of auras is as the energy that someone around you emits. Some people make you nervous; others relax you. This, in some ways, could be seen as a reaction to the energy they radiate.

<section class="main-section" id="Are_auras_the_same_thing_as_vibes?">
  <header>Are auras the same thing as vibes?</header>
  <p><code>Kind of!
<i>“‘Vibes’ are short for ‘vibrational frequency,’ which is what an aura is comprised of”</i>, Lonsdale says.</p>
<p>Your energy may “tell” someone around you that you’re angry or elated, distraught or excited, even without you saying a word. Likewise, you may sense those emotions from another person.</p>
<p><i>“You’re tapping into the frequency that person is operating on”</i>, Emma Mildon, author of <b>“The Soul Searcher’s Handbook”</b> and a self-described spiritual activist, tells Healthline. <i>“Our frequency, or vibe, is what others can sense or what attracts or repels us from others, depending on how our frequency works with theirs.”</i>

  <section class="main-section" id="Does_everyone_have_an_aura?">
  <header>Does everyone have an aura?</header>
  <p><code>Yes, every living human has an energy field around them. Other living things, such as trees, flowers, or animals, can also have an energy field.</p>
<p>A 2018 paper published in the <b>Journal of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences</b> describes the human body as containing both visible and invisible parts. The author goes on to say that measuring a human energy system would require tools beyond what scientists have access to today.</p>
<p>While no scientific studies prove that everyone has an aura, it’s generally accepted that every living human has an energy field around them.</p>
<p>Some believe that the human energy field may be more complex than that of other organisms because we’re more evolved.
<i>“We’re all broadcasting like radio stations without even knowing it”</i>, Lonsdale says.

  <section class="main-section" id="What_does_an_aura_look_like?">
  <header>What does an aura look like?</header>
  <p><code>Some feel that how an aura looks depends on how you capture it.
In her <b>Radiant Human</b> project, Lonsdale uses a specialized camera to capture the subject’s energy.</p>
<p><i>“The camera uses hand sensors that pick up this energy field and a proprietary algorithm matches this energy to a color,”</i> she says.
Another type of aural photography, called Kirlian photography, is believed to capture the aura as an egg-shaped circle around the physical body.</p>
<p><i>“Artists have depicted it like a halo or a bubble of light surround[ing] the physical body,”</i> Pat Longo, spiritual healer and author of <b>“The Gifts Beneath Your Anxiety: Simple Spiritual Tools to Find Peace, Awaken the Power Within and Heal Your Life”</b>, tells Healthline.

They follow the beat of their own drummers.</p>
<p id="magenta_text"><b>Magentas</b> love to shock people, to shake them from their ordinary, humdrum existence.

<p id="magenta_text">Because of their outrageous behavior, <b>Magentas</b> prefer to live in large, crowded cities where they don’t stand out as much and aren’t pressured to conform. These free spirits aren’t usually concerned about what others think, but in large cities they are more apt to have the freedom to express themselves.</p>

<p id="logical_tan_text"><b>Logical Tans</b> are very logical and analytical. They choose to process every step, from one through ten. <b>Logical Tans</b> do not like to skip or miss anything. Their method of processing cannot be rushed. They need to analyze and comprehend the logic in each step before proceeding to the next.
<b>Logical Tans</b> like to establish a firm foundation, and then slowly build brick by brick, step by step. Otherwise, they are afraid the entire project will collapse on them.</p>
<p id="logical_tan_text">Not being risk-takers, these methodical thinkers need to see all the data and all the facts before making any moves. Everything for <b>Logical Tans</b> is done in an orderly and sequential manner. Every detail is meticulously processed.</p>
<p id="logical_tan_text"><b>Logical Tans</b> typically form very habitual patterns. They are more comfortable repeating the same duties day after day. They don’t like their routines to be altered. Even rearranging the furniture in their homes can throw them off and cause them to feel awkward until they are able to readjust to the new situation.</p>

  <p id="red_overlay_text"><code>People are not born with a <b>Red Overlay</b>. A <b>Red Overlay</b> is usually added to the outer bands of the aura early on in life because the person felt a need for protection. While a <b>Red Overlay</b> can offer protection, it also can become a terrible burden to bear.</p>
<p id="red_overlay_text">The two most common indications that a person is carrying a <b>Red Overlay</b> are either feelings of intense anger and rage, or continuous struggle and self-sabotage. If these people don’t eventually remove the <b>Red Overlay</b> from their aura, their protective shield will eventually become their prison.
People usually add a <b>Red Overlay</b> to their aura for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<p id="red_overlay_text">They have had a life-threatening situation at birth or at a young age, which caused them to perceive that they may die, or that the world was not a safe place. Examples of life-threatening situations can include birth complications, severe illness, choking, drowning or suffocating. Many people do not remember these incidents, and so the source of their anger or struggle remains a mystery to them. They frequently have feelings of dread or of impending disaster for reasons unknown to them.</p>
<p id="red_overlay_text">People may also add a <b>Red Overlay</b> if they have been physically, emotionally or mentally abandoned or rejected. <b>Red Overlays</b> frequently appear in people who were unwanted children, adopted or separated from a parent at a young age. This can also apply to children who felt emotionally abandoned by a parent, even when the parent appeared to be physically present in the home.</p>
<p id="red_overlay_text">The most obvious and traceable causes for a <b>Red Overlay</b> in the aura are those cases in which people have been physically, emotionally or mentally abused. Children who have been sexually abused, physically beaten, or raised by alcoholic or verbally abusive parents usually feel that the world is an unsafe and undependable place and that protection is necessary for survival.</p>
<p id="red_overlay_text"><b>Red Overlays</b> can even appear around children who felt emotionally or physically smothered or suppressed. They feel betrayed by the adults, who were supposed to love, nurture and protect them as children. Not everyone who felt abandoned by a parent has a <b>Red Overlay</b>, however. The experience had to be intense enough or serious enough to have threatened the emotional or physical survival instincts of the child.

  <p><code>Many spiritual advisers, energy practitioners, and others who work with aural health believe that the physical body is closely connected to the emotional and spiritual bodies.</p>
<p>The aura is seen as just one representation of this connection.
Understanding and being aware of your own aura can take time. But the practice of focusing on your own spiritual and emotional health may go a long way to helping your overall health, no matter the outcome of any attempt to overhaul or revitalize your aural health.</p>
<p>Positive thoughts can bring energy, healing, and great self-appreciation.
